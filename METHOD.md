Spatializing RNN samples - understanding sequence as space?
Layering sequences in time
to better understand the experience of a specific time
Similar to generated "memories" used to prompt engagement with archives / accumulations?

Difficulty in understanding time as not moving always forward, material always being generated and accumulated
Difficulty in deciding whether to give up progress / to go backwards / back-propagate 
The results: wavering, funky, envelopes. Self-piercing.
AI is unable to predict the present
This music is cancer - unregulated growth, patterns without purpose, form without function

normally I worked by editing - subtracting pieces from a whole, putting these pieces side by side, above, below, arranged into a new whole. 
i played with this subtraction in mind—any passing of time, however brief or durable, could be made to stand on its own, a sequence of weak links meant only to be cut and re-joined, or trimmed, disposed. It doesn’t matter. 

Collapse
Converge

Long short-term memory 
Exploding, catastrophic forgetting
Exploding gradient, vanishing gradient.

Variation, encoding, flow

Seamless integration
Hold structures small and large together, remember short and long term

self-piercing
How much is interruption how much is suturing / connecting / glue [?]

Chemo boredom, time dilation, time loss, hair loss. 
Bodyeverything dysmorphia. 
Onco-ontology
And puberty. 

Requires extreme duration, or the illusion / hint of extreme duration. How to achieve this, given limits on access, attention, navigability?

Shared environments
Sounds in relation to themselves

Control doesn’t make sense.
