# compression-as-explanation

I’m not really a theorist. I feel you. 

Im in a formless and boundless landscape, because I can, because of the free play—building and destroying connections, patterns, and structures—which the territory invites. 

Why am I un-tethered? How did I learn to work? What makes me make?

Memory versus attention.

Some of this can be attributed to a tendency, a sense of responsibility, to piece together how you and I arrived at our current positions.

Oh, the originals? 

The problematics of machine intelligence have thus far (crucially) pointed towards the encoding of certain cultural and systemic biases via the particularities of training data used, and the subsequent decisions around how to (cautiously, critically, ethically) apply the models once trained.  

Given what we have so far, what happens next? And next? And next?

Direct this question at the centrality of metaphors, of latent space and semantic vectors. Learning depend on the transfer of forms of knowledge from one domain to another. 

Garbage in, garbage out (GIGO). 

Frameworks for translational research (use of a somewhat controlled model situation to study a less controllable wild situation… e.g. transgenic mice, or computer simulation)

Can a sick AI be diagnosed? Would this diagnosis be a simulation, a model?

Given a choice, choose rich, lossless content, equitably shared experience, and direct action via direct contact via directive thought and language. I enjoy indulging in forced metaphors, transferring knowledge, tendencies, and affinities across domains. I learn by abstraction.

Some of this is an internal conversation about ethics. Multiple moral personas.

Paraprofessional.

What does not making it explicit do? 

The point of unsupervised learning

How raw is raw? What is lost by making sound symbolic: timbre, context, texture, specificity.

Encoding ambivalence, detachment, resignation? “Fuck it”

Honestly I would like to make things as simple as possible. simplifying things that we might think of as overly complex (complexity itself, even!) so that they might be understood more easily, more naturally, by more people. 

But! What happens when I extract only the parts that I love? Or even, attempt to extract the whole, leaving a scar where it was taken? Can I pick and choose from any source? Can u translate 4 me?

Average poetry is not good.

I tend to ask the wrong questions: poorly phrased, unanswerable. Rhetorical, loaded, leading. 

What does it mean to “naturally” understand something? 

The work of grasping, decoding, disentangling, clarifying, piecing together, revealing... a noisy, weak, encoded signal someone is sending… this moves me, forcefully, every time. 

Does it help to experience anxiety collectively (versus alone)?

Like “act natural” or “naturally inclined towards”—innate, magnetic / gravitational pull, a pleasing order is achieved. Drifting, with ease. clinamen. Neither work nor play.

An awful lot of people want to know what it’s like to see from more than one point of view. What’s it like for a plant to see electric light?

Material can be anything you want it to be? Or no?

Empathy is meaningful because it is limited, it drains me, it ends in fatigue, and beyond that—counter-empathy, resentment, ambivalence.

Somewhere between Daniel Dennett’s “Why You Can’t Make a Computer That Feels Pain” and Susan Sontag’s “Illness as Metaphor”

How can media—as in anything that mediates—contend with illness and pain, not as a metaphor, but a point of connection, a common object? 

The subjective experience of pain, as well as the capacity of those providing care, depends on a limited reserve of attention. Can attention be restored or conserved, sustained or reinforced, guided or let loose? Is “giving” attention the same as transferring it from one person to another, in the sense that it can be reused, modified, re-formatted?

My culture, which is so strong, so individualist, so against expression, and so insistent on a necessity for dialogue and for coming together; for action in support of what we call the common cause: To ‘speak with one voice’. 

Literalness. 

Once, I really appreciated being called out as a humanist, as one who depends on thought experiments for cognitive flexibility, for a capacity to express. 

Wherever “appreciation” sits in my window of affect tolerance. 

Improvement towards no end.

The sound and image of eliminating variance, trying to get at exactitude, establishing a fixed point. Confirmation, synchronized. 

If all of this sounds way too specific, it’s because specificity is the objective - to come away with an accurate imagining; finished patterns that were left incomplete by sparse representation: gaps filled in, substituting for that vague and immaterial stuff.

Hoping to hear, see, feel something pure? Automatically? 

Nothing is ever really automatic, fully, anyway! Choices are made. A direction, an orientation, a gait, a way of moving towards a goal that one has in mind, a route. 

If RNN is short-term, working memory, by navigating its forking paths, long-term memory takes hold. 

Cassette: 

Sounds made for no audience, I take notes, to get a feel. 
Self-sampling.

Were you looking for something in specific?

Enough variety to give the impression of a whole. Shadows and highlights sketched in to show a shape’s volume, depth. 

Do you want the shape or the substance? I want the good distortion. 

Simply put, you tend to think you know what music is, what noise is, what a medium is, what a message is, but then we see how these can be much more slippery and inter-related aspects of a signal.  

Noise, among other things, is “common”. It’s shared, it’s accessible, it’s persistent and ever-present. 

Each generation has it’s own common noise, it’s own learned representation of background, of what it is we regress towards without structure to compel us forward. Not always silence, buzz, or drone; this middle ground is above all a pattern, no matter what. Wallpaper, routine, loop, infinite and unchanging terrain. Or rather, changing, familiar, relentless. 

Like Lucier’s “I am Sitting in a Room”, the particulars of the tape, the voice, the speakers, the microphone, the room, all combine to give each succeeding wave of feedback its tone. 

It sounds like the street, like a closet; like a bell long after striking, tending towards quiet. 

A restricted space.

It’s no accident, it is tendency. A matter of taste, if you will—of preference, entrainment—that gives the curve of expectation its shape, embedded in the design of the system, in what is remembered, what is attended to, what is passed on. 

Viability is attractive. Continuity, sustained variation, a meander, the sensation of floating.

What does floating prove about the ocean? What does drowning prove?

As an editor, do you ever feel regret for the material you’ve removed? Remorse? Compassion?

Something horrible to make sense of.

## Obviously bad, but I feel a strong, awful sadness for:

- Gentrification
- Abuse
- Racism 
- Poverty
- Greed
- Patriarchy
- White supremacy
- Homophobia
- Slavery
- Displacement 


## Obviously sad, but I feel a strong, neutral love for:

- Cancer 
- AIDS 
- Mental illness
- Disability
- Viruses
- Quarantine
- Filth 
- Shame
- Welfare 
- Pain
- Dyslexia
- Seizures

## Possibly neutral. but I feel a strong, awful love for:

- Simplicity 
- Discipline 
- Responsibility / accountability 
- Translation 


## I formed a thought with a list of metaphors:

- Non-identical Twins, close friends or neighbors, weak-links
greasy mirrors
- poor / lossy copies, crude models, crude translations
- Non-standard fitting of shapes, loose connections
- Draped forms - what’s under that ___?
- things casting shadows. 
- Using a shadow to reason about the shape that casts it and the quality of light.
- Reverb with the original source of sound removed
- Faded images, color bleed, blotter paper, impressions
- Tracks (footprints etc)
- a complicated mixture separated into slices 
- Attempts at rotating an image of a knot
- Staring contest
- Swapping attributes, wearing a mask or second skin. Speaking with someone else’s voice (or words?)
- Translation to simplified English (limited vocabulary)
- Reduced color space, downsampling 
- Dropout loss
- Speaking while breathing in

What is the negative space of metaphors / what do analogies surround?

How to algorithmically detect, predict metaphors? 


Questions:
What are some alternatives to simplification that can produce the same lightness, portability, and access—without loss?

Can stories of global consequence be told from local positions? Or do we need to fly all over the place all the time?

How would a “listening act” - a corresponding gesture to the “speech act” in which change is effected by pronouncement - look, feel, move, provoke?
